rbrfss
======

The goal of rbrfss is to quickly develop complex survey designs (survey) with BRFSS data. This package is poorly written in its current state and is just a combination of common functions that I use with BRFSS. It's really just a trial run of programming with dplyr (yikes) and devtools package development. Beware of package dependencies. Also, it's probably useless without my customized brfss dataset. More updates soon.
